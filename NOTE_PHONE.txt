The format for this dictionary format is:

the    0.16      0.08    2.17    1.13    d i
the    0.99      0.04    2.14    1.15    d ə
the      0.01    0.14    2.48    1.18    ð i
the      0.02    0.12    1.87    1.23    ð ə
the      0.11    0.15    2.99    1.15    ə
The first float column is the probability of the pronunciation,
 the next float is the probability of silence following the pronunciation,
  and the final two floats are correction terms for preceding silence and non-silence. 
  Given that each entry in a dictionary is independent and there is no way to encode information about the preceding context, 
  the correction terms are calculated as how much more common was silence or non-silence compared to what
   we would expect factoring out the likelihood of silence from the previous word. More details are found in get_prons.sh and 
   the related paper.
